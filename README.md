# lions-and-tigers

By: Bobby DiDomenico

While the Title is lions-and-tigers, this site has nothing to do with them. This site utilizes Dog API (link: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/breed) in order to show the user pictures of all dog breeds. All you need to do is click the dropdown on the page and select the dog breed that you want to see and pictures of that breed will start to appear and cycle between each other. 



This was made following the tutorial made by LearnWebCode (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmGmLFcukM)
